# Code Review Report

This repository was reviewed for compliance with the guidelines in `AGENTS.md` and other documentation. The following discrepancies and pending items were found.

## Disclaimers

- **Present**: `README.md` and `AGENTS.md` contain a clear non‑affiliation disclaimer for the American Legion, as required. Example from `README.md`:
  > This project is being developed to support Boys State & Girls State programs affiliated with the American Legion, but is **not** created, funded, or officially supported by the American Legion. No endorsement or sponsorship is implied.
- **Present**: Most public pages (`index.html`, `dashboard.html`, `logs.html`, etc.) include a footer line stating the app is not affiliated with or endorsed by the American Legion.
- **Missing**: `public/login.html` and `public/register.html` do **not** display a similar disclaimer. These pages should include the same non‑affiliation statement as other pages.

## Coverage and Testing

- `AGENTS.md` requires automated tests and maintaining the coverage threshold:
  ```
  * Automated tests for all new features/fixes and logic
  * If tests do not meet coverage requirements, increase coverage.  Do NOT decrease requirements.
  ```
- Running `npm test` shows all suites pass and coverage for branches is **80.07%**, meeting the required 80% threshold.

## Planned Features

- `AGENTS.md` lists several agents as **planned** (Election Agent, Progress Tracking Agent, Integration Agents) which are not implemented in the current codebase. Implementation work is pending for these features.

## Summary of Required Actions

1. Add the non‑affiliation disclaimer to `public/login.html` and `public/register.html`.
2. Continue work on planned agents/features as documented in `AGENTS.md`.
